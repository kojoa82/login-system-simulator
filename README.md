# Python Login System Simulator

## Overview
A simple console-based login system built in Python.  
Users can register with a username and password, then log in using their credentials.

This project demonstrates basic backend logic including user storage, authentication, and control flow.

## Features
- User registration
- User login validation
- Dictionary-based user storage
- Menu-driven interface
- Input handling and validation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## How to Run
1. Run the Python file.
2. Choose:
   - "r" to register
   - "l" to login
   - "q" to quit
3. Follow the prompts in the console.

## Future Improvements
- Add login attempt limits
- Add password strength validation
- Store users persistently (e.g., file or database)
- Convert to web application using Flask
